.py = Reading Analogue Potentiometer Voltages (Accurately) using Python.  
My code is formatted for use with Raspberry Pi Pico. though the code is only a guide and can easily be interchanged to fit your needs.  
The key info here is the mathematical equation (for accurate readings) and how you can implement that in your project.  
  
Thank you.
